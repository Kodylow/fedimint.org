MiniMint is a modular federated e-cash prototype still under heavy development written in Rust. It already supports all main operations (deposit/withdraw via both on-chain Bitcoin and Lightning, e-cash transfers) and comes with a rudimentary CLI client. Some features are still missing and blocking mainnet deployments, but the project is moving quickly. If you are interested in contributing [check out the GitHub repository](https://github.com/fedimint/minimint).

# Old recording from earlier demo

The asciinema recording is rather wide, so if you have a small screen it might not show the entire recorded area.
We recommend to watch it in full screen mode.
